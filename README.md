# GenoPheno-ID Analysis

This project analyzes genotype-phenotype relationships focusing on **Intellectual Disability (ID)** using data extracted from various annotation and ontology sources.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `scripts/genopheno_analysis.R`: Main analysis script (untouched from original author).
- `data/`: Raw data files (not included due to privacy).
- `results/`: Output figures and summary tables.
  
## 🧠 Key Analysis Steps

- Preprocessing of HPO and Genopheno data
- Identification of genes commonly diagnosed in ID
- Analysis of mode of inheritance (MOI)
- Visualization of gene-disease and gene-HPO term associations

## 📈 Visualizations

- ID gene frequency distribution
- Percentage distribution of diseases per gene
- MOI breakdown per gene
- Disease pleiotropy per gene

## 🔧 Requirements

- R 4.0.2
- Libraries: `tidyverse`
